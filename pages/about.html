<p>Modern society is faced with a growing degree of security threats both internally and externally, but access to the right and timely information can be a defining factor. Technological advancements have been advantageous to the police in terms of reporting, monitoring and responding to crime and criminality. At present, crime reportage is being done manually in most police stations via the use of pen and paper to document statements. This method is not only slow and ineffective but could lead to loss of valuable time and productivity. This work presents the design and implementation of &ldquo;SIRS&rdquo;, a digital web&nbsp; application for reporting loss or theft. It leverages the current proliferation of mobile devices. The web application makes information about reported cases of loss or theft readily available and accessible to the populace. The agile model of the system development life cycle (SDLC) was adopted throughout the stages of requirement gathering, to the design, analysis, implementation and testing. The application was implemented using Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) for the user interface, Java programming language for code binding, MySQL and PHP for a robust database. The application was deployed on devices for usability testing and it achieved a mean score of 83.5 based on the system usability scale (SUS). SIRS will enhance efficiency in reporting and accessing the information on reported cases of loss and theft. Furthermore, it would help to allay uncertainties of buying stolen properties as users can easily check up on an item put up as stolen.</p>
